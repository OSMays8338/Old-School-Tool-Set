$title[Task Weight Explanation]
$description[
The weight determines how often a monster is assigned as a Slayer task. Higher weight means a higher chance of being picked. For example, if Aberrant Spectres have a weight of 6 and Gargoyles have 10, Gargoyles are more likely to be assigned. Other factors like blocked tasks and Slayer level also affect the outcome.]
